## Objective: Explore and deploy a template that is automatically generated by the Azure portal

> [!hint] The "fill in the blank" parameters when deploying templates via the Portal is the same experience for any templates with parameters
>
> [!knowledge] The Azure Portal generates templates that are not flexible and not reusable as they are custom built for your exact build. In the real world, you shouldn't need as many Parameter fields as most entries can be derived from other information.

7. Check the progress of the deployment under the resource groupâ€¦ observing the resources that are deployed and still to be deployed
1. Click on the template / input to see the historical nature of the deployment.
